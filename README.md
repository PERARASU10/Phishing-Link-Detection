# Phishing URL Detection Tool

This project is a machine learning-based tool designed to detect phishing URLs. It employs a RandomForestClassifier to predict whether a given URL is phishing or legitimate. The tool is equipped with a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) built using tkinter, making it easy for users to input URLs and receive predictions in real-time.

## Features

Machine Learning Model: Trained using a Random Forest classifier on a dataset of phishing and legitimate URLs.
    
GUI Interface: Provides a clean and intuitive interface to input URLs and get predictions.
    
Basic Animation: Adds a simple animation effect to enhance the user experience when displaying the prediction results.

## Installation
 ## Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/PERARASU10/Brainwave_matrix_intern.git
cd phishing-url-detection
```

## Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your machine.

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn tkinter

```

## Dataset

Ensure that your dataset file (in CSV format) is located in the project directory. Update the file_path variable in the scanner.py script to point to your dataset file.

## Running the Tool

You can start the phishing detection tool by executing the following command:
```
python scanner.py
```
This will launch the GUI, allowing you to enter a URL and receive a prediction on whether the URL is likely phishing or legitimate.

## Usage

Launch the Tool: Run python scanner.py.

Enter URL: Type the URL you want to check in the text field.

Get Prediction: Click "Predict" to see if the URL is classified as phishing or legitimate.

## Screenshots

Hereâ€™s what the interface looks like:

## Troubleshooting

File Not Found Error: Ensure that the file_path in scanner.py correctly points to your dataset file.
    
Missing Dependencies: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to ensure all dependencies are installed.
    
GUI Not Displaying Properly: Check if you have tkinter installed, as it is required for the GUI.
